A simple and modern ToDo application built with **React**, **Redux**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The app allows users to manage tasks by adding, editing, marking as complete, and filtering tasks based on specific criteria such as importance and date.

  - Important tasks
- **Toggle Sidebar**: The sidebar can be toggled to expand or collapse, providing a more spacious task view.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is responsive, with a clean UI for both desktop and mobile views.
- **Task Details Panel**: Users can click on a task to view its detailed information in a side panel.
